# â€‹Overview

You're on a mission to help the local Library to build an MVP books records system to replace the current paper records they have been using.

More details can be found in the pdf.

# Backend

**Spring Boot** is used as the main framework to develop the APIs and model the business requirements.

**Java** is the language used.

**PostgreSQL** is the database used.

## Requirements

1. [Java](https://www.java.com/en/).
2. [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). To set it up, follow the instructions from their [guide](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

## How to run

1. In the terminal, change directory to the base directory of the backend service application: `cd library-api`
2. Run the command: `mvn spring-boot:run`
3. If all is good, you will see the following image:

4. We can also test it via [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). Sending a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/getTop3ReadBooks?country_code=us` will yield us the following result as seen in the image:

## Testing

1. In the same directory mentioned in the previous section, run: `mvn test`

# Frontend

**ReactJS** is the main library used to develop the web app.

**TypeScript** is the language used.

## Requirements

1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## How to run

1. In the terminal, change directory to the base directory of the web app: `cd library-webapp`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the command: `npm start`
4. If all is good, the web app opened in your browser will look like the one in the following image:
